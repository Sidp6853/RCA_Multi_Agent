  "root_cause": "The error occurs in create_user_account due to a mismatch in the attribute name used to query the User model:\n\nuser_exist = session.query(User).filter(User.emails == data.email).first()\n\n\u2022 Actual Model Field: The 'User' model (defined in app/models/user.py) has an attribute named 'email' (singular).\n\u2022 Referenced in Query: The code in app/services/user.py attempts to access 'User.emails' (plural).\n\nThis causes an AttributeError when the application tries to filter the User model by an non-existent 'emails' attribute. The error occurs at line 18 in the create_user_account function, exactly where the stack trace indicated.\n\nThe application code attempts to check if a user with a given email already exists in the database, but it uses the incorrect attribute name 'emails' instead of 'email' for the User model, leading to the AttributeError. Based on the detailed root cause analysis, I have all the necessary information to fix this issue. The critical information includes:\n\n1. Error location: app/services/user.py, line 18 in the create_user_account function\n2. Issue details: The 'User' model defines the email attribute as 'email' (singular), but the query in the service layer attempts to use 'emails' (plural).\n3. ** Relevant code file**: app/services/user.py\n4. ** Affected function**: create_user_account\n5. Model definition: The 'User' class in app/models/user.py has 'email = Column(String(255), unique=True, index=True)'\n",
